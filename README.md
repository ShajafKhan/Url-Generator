# URL Generator

A simple, responsive webpage for generating personalized countdown and birthday card URLs. Enter a name and a target date to create two shareable links: one for a countdown timer and one for a digital birthday card. Each generated URL can be shortened for easy sharing.

## Features

- üéÇ Generate a digital birthday card URL with a custom name.
- ‚è≥ Generate a countdown page URL targeting a specific date.
- üìÖ Easy-to-use form with real-time validation for date inputs.
- üîó Automatically shortens generated URLs using the TinyURL API.
- üì± Responsive and clean interface for use on any device.

## How It Works

1. **Enter your name** and the **countdown end date** (year, month, and day).
2. Click **"Generate URLs"**.
3. The app produces two links:
   - **Countdown Page URL:** Shows a countdown to the selected date with the person's name.
   - **Birthday Card Page URL:** Displays a digital birthday card with the person's name.
4. Both URLs are shortened for easy sharing.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Fill out the form with the required information.
3. Share the generated links.

<!--## Example

- **Countdown Page:**  
  `https://yourdomain.com/Countdown.html?end-date=2025-12-31T00:00:00&n=John&birthday-card-url=https%3A%2F%2Fyourdomain.com%2FResponsive-Birthday-Card.html%3Fn%3DJohn`

- **Birthday Card Page:**  
  `https://yourdomain.com/Responsive-Birthday-Card.html?n=John`

*(URLs above are illustrative; use the generator for actual links!)*
-->
## Tech Stack

- HTML5 & CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- [TinyURL API](https://tinyurl.com/app/dev) for link shortening

## Customization

- The base URLs for countdown and birthday card pages (`Countdown.html` and `Responsive-Birthday-Card.html`) can be changed in the script as needed.
- Styling can be customized in the `<style>` section.

## Deployment

1. Copy all files (including `Countdown.html` and `Responsive-Birthday-Card.html`) to your web server or GitHub Pages.
2. Set your base URLs in the code if your directory structure changes.
3. Open the main HTML file in a browser to use.
